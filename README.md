     - Positive: Sentiment score > 0.05  
     - Neutral: Sentiment score between -0.05 and 0.05  
     - Negative: Sentiment score < -0.05  

4. **Visualization and Trend Analysis**  
   - Visualized sentiment distribution using bar plots.  
   - Analyzed sentiment trends over time (e.g., monthly trends) to understand changes in public opinion.  
   - Identified popular hashtags and their frequency using bar plots.  

5. **Insights Extraction**  
   - Top hashtags were identified to determine key trending topics.
